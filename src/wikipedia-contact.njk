<p>If you want to get in touch with me about something to do with Wikipedia, please <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GorillaWarfare">leave a message on my Wikipedia talk page</a> or email
  me
  at <a href="mailto:gorillawarfarewikipedia@gmail.com">gorillawarfarewikipedia@gmail.com</a>. I am <a
    href="https://discord.com/users/298979974029901827">GorillaWarfare</a> in the Wikimedia Discord server. Please note
  that
  if you are contacting me off-wiki in hopes of discussing the content of a Wikipedia page, I will almost certainly ask
  you to bring the discussion to the article talk page on Wikipedia where all editors can weigh in. You may wish to read
  this <a href="/wikipedia-concern">FAQ of sorts</a> before beginning such a discussion.</p>
<p>For non-Wikipedia-related matters, the best way to get in touch with me is via email to <a
    href="mailto:molly@mollywhite.net">molly@mollywhite.net</a>.</p>
<p>You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF">Twitter</a>, although if you are hoping to tweet at
  me about a Wikipedia-related topic please see my <a href="/wikipedia-concern">page discussing this</a> first.</p>
<p>For people trying to comply with Wikipedia's policy on <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Harassment#Posting_of_personal_information">linking to accounts on
    other
    websites (WP:OUTING)</a>, the accounts on my <a href="/verify">verification</a> page are mine and can be considered
  to
  be self-disclosed and safe to mention on-wiki. I consider any links to my accounts from this website to be
  self-disclosed, even if I forget to add them to that list. I don't use the username "GorillaWarfare" widely outside of
  Wikimedia contexts, so most accounts on other websites with that username are not mine.
