<h1 class="title">I'm Molly White.</h1>
<p>
  I'm a researcher, software engineer, and writer. I research and write about the cryptocurrency industry,
  blockchains, the idea known as "web3", and the tech industry more broadly. I'm a fellow at the Harvard
  <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/">Library Innovation Lab</a>, and an affiliate of the
  <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman-Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I run the website
  <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/"><i>Web3 is Going Just Great</i></a>, where I highlight examples of how
  cryptocurrencies, web3 projects, and the industry surrounding them are failing to live up to their promises. I also
  publish a regular <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/">newsletter</a>, and have written a
  <a href="https://blog.mollywhite.net/blockchain/">series of essays</a> about blockchains.
</p>
<p>
  I regularly
  <a href="/press">speak to journalists and do media appearances</a>. I also have given <a href="/speaking">talks and
    guest lectures</a>, and have advised policymakers and regulators in and outside of the United States.
</p>
<p>
  Before veering into spending so much of my time thinking about cryptocurrency and its implications for the web,
  finance, and society writ large, I was a professional software engineer.

  I have also been an active editor of the English Wikipedia for over fifteen years, where I edit under the username
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GorillaWarfare">GorillaWarfare</a>. I am an administrator and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Functionaries">functionary</a>, and previously served three terms on
  the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee">Arbitration Committee</a>. I care deeply about
  free and open access to high-quality information, and view projects like Wikipedia as critical infrastructure.
