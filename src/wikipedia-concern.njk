  <h1>Wikipedia FAQ</h1>
  <p>You're probably here because you tweeted at or emailed me about a Wikipedia article I helped to write. I get a lot
  of emails and tweets about my activities there, and so have made this page both as an FAQ of sorts for common
  questions/complaints, but also to set some boundaries on how I am willing to engage.</p>
  <p>For various reasons, <b>I prefer to handle specific Wikipedia-related matters on-wiki.</b> Although I do enjoy
  talking about Wikipedia on social media, when it comes to specific concerns or questions about an article I prefer
  to take it on-wiki. For one, I have found that people like to use ostensible concerns about the quality or integrity
  of Wikipedia to harass me when they really have no particular interest in the website at all. Secondly, it is far
  more transparent for other people who have questions about an article to have these discussions on the article talk
  page, rather than privately via email or deep in my Twitter mentions. It also allows other Wikipedia editors to give
  their input.</p>
  <p>I am always happy to discuss any concerns you might have with my editing or the articles I write, but please raise
  them on-wiki. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount">Creating an account</a> on
  Wikipedia is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F">quick, free, and does not
    require you to provide any personal information</a> (although it is recommended you provide your email address so
  you can recover your account if you forget the password).</p>
  <h3 class="faq-question">
    <a class="faq-link" href="#check-author" aria-label="Permalink to this section">&#35;
    </i>
  </a>
  <a id="check-author">You wrote [some article] and I have a
    complaint</a>
</h3>
<div class="faq-answer">
  <p>Before going any further, have you checked that I have actually been a major contributor to the article? For one,
    it is extremely rare for a Wikipedia article to have a sole author—while there is often a core group of
    contributors to an article, generally pages are collaborations. If you believe I wrote an article solely because
    you saw a banner like this at the bottom of the page:</p>
  <div class="in-text-image"><img src="https://www.mollywhite.net/images/lastedited.png"
      alt="Banner that shows at the bottom of Wikipedia pages when visited on mobile, which reads &quot;Last edited 2 hours ago by GorillaWarfare&quot;">
  </div>
  <p>please click on the "Last edited..." link to view the page history and at least check whether I've contributed
    substantially to the page, or if that is just showing because I'm the last person to edit the page, even though my
    contribution may have been something minor like reverting vandalism.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="faq-question">
  <a class="faq-link" href="#complaint" aria-label="Permalink to this section">&#35;</a>
  <a
    id="complaint">I have verified that you substantially
    contributed to [some article] and I have a complaint about it</a>
</h3>
<div class="faq-answer">
  <p>Please describe your concern in a new section on the talk page of the article. Feel free to get my attention by
    including the template <code>
      {% raw %}{{ping|GorillaWarfare}}
      {% endraw %}
    </code> in your message, and be sure you
    sign the message by
    including four tildes at the end (<code>~~~~</code>). At this point, if you want to tweet at me to make sure I see
    it, that's fine with me.</p>
  <p>
    But if you <em>only </em> tweet at me with your concern, I am more than likely going to ask you to discuss it on
    the article talk page. Why? Well, like I said, articles are rarely written only by one person, and so there are
    likely to be other people who will be interested in hearing and responding to your feedback. But also, I have
    found that people like to use ostensible concerns about the quality or integrity of Wikipedia to harass me on
    Twitter, when they really have no particular interest in the website at all. I'm more than willing to engage in a
    discussion with you on-wiki about any article I work on, but I'm not going to engage in protracted Twitter
    back-and-forth.</p>
  <p>If you need help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount">creating an
      account</a> in order to discuss your concerns on the article talk page, feel free to tweet at or otherwise
    contact me and I'll be happy to help you out.</p>
  <p>If you really want to go above and beyond, before posting your question, check if it fits into any of these
    categories of complaints:</p>
  <div class="faq-accordions">
    <h4 class="faq-question accordion" id="bias" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-controls="#bias-answer">&rsaquo;
      [Article] is biased</h4>
    <div class="accordion-panel" id="bias-answer" role="region" aria-hidden="" aria-controlledby="#bias">
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>When this comes up, the first thing I'm going to do is make sure you're familiar with <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">Wikipedia's policy on neutral point
            of view</a>. Specifically, that Wikipedia articles must "represent fairly, proportionately, and, as far as
          possible, without editorial bias, <em>all the significant views that have been published by reliable sources
            on a topic</em>". If you come with this complaint, I'm going to ask whether you mean that
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>there are other significant views published by reliable sources (which you can provide) that present a
            different viewpoint that needs to be represented in the article</li>
          <li>the article does not accurately reflect the current sources that are being used</li>
          <li>the article doesn't represent <em>your</em> view on the subject, and you can't find or aren't sure if
            reliable sources are available that reflect that view.</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <p>If you mean a or b, I definitely am interested in hearing what you have to say. If you mean c: Wikipedia
          only reflects what is published in reliable sources, and so if your view is not supported by sourcing, the
          Wikipedia article won't be changed to incorporate it.</p>
        <p>You may also find this essay illuminating: <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_means_neutral_editing,_not_neutral_content">"NPOV means
            neutral editing, not neutral content"</a>.</p>

    <h4 class="faq-question accordion" id="biased-sources" role="button" tabindex="0"
      aria-controls="#biased-sources-answer">&rsaquo; [Article] only uses
      sources that are biased towards the [left|right]</h4>
    <div class="accordion-panel" id="biased-sources-answer" role="region" aria-hidden=""
      aria-controlledby="#biased-sources">
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Some people are under the impression that sources with a point of view are unusable on Wikipedia, which is
          not the case. From the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#Biased_or_opinionated_sources">reliable
            sources policy</a>: "Wikipedia articles are required to present a neutral point of view. However, reliable
          sources are not required to be neutral, unbiased, or objective."</p>
        <p>However, we do try to accurately reflect the balance of viewpoints represented in reliable sources, so if
          you have reliable sources that take a different slant that you think should also be represented in the
          article, we'd love to hear about them on the article talk page.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4 class="faq-question accordion" id="feminist" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-controls="#feminist-answer">
      &rsaquo; You're a [feminist|leftist], you're not allowed to write
      about [the manosphere|the right]</h4>
    <div class="accordion-panel" id="feminist-answer" role="region" aria-hidden="" aria-controlledby="#feminist">
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>I have also gotten this in the other direction (e.g. "you're a feminist, you're not allowed to write about
          feminism!"), but due to my editing interests I mostly get the complaint about writing about things I am
          politically or ideologically opposed to. Wikipedia disallows <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Advocacy">advocacy</a>, that is, "using Wikipedia to promote
          personal beliefs or agendas at the expense of Wikipedia's goals and core content policies, including
          verifiability and neutral point of view." However, Wikipedia editors are not expected to be completely
          bereft of opinions. I carefully adhere to the policies on reliable sourcing, neutral point of view, etc. and
          I personally am particularly careful in my editing in these areas because I know it attracts a lot of
          outside scrutiny.</p>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Please specify which statement in the article is not supported by the sourcing used in the page, or provide
          reliable sourcing that contradicts the statement. If you feel the statement is true, but is given too much
          prominence in the article, please explain your evaluation. If the statement is true and given prominence
          that is proportionate to its coverage in reliable sources, but you still think the statement is "defamatory"
          and ought to be removed, please a) read up a bit about what <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation">defamation</a> actually means, and b) recognize that
          Wikipedia articles are not meant to be puff pieces for their subjects. If a person/company/organization/etc.
          has received significant coverage for an unpleasant reason, that will still be included in their page.</p>

<div class="faq-answer">
  <p>With limited exceptions, dispute resolution is handled on-wiki. Feel free to open a discussion about me/my
    conduct/whatever your concern may be by following the instructions at <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution">the page describing types of dispute
      resolution</a>. However, I will note that the first step in basically any dispute is to try to discuss the issue
    with the person, either on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GorillaWarfare">my user talk page</a>
    or on the article talk page (if applicable), so I'd recommend doing that first before going to a wider venue.</p>
  <p>Occasionally people want to go directly to the Arbitration Committee with concerns about me, for some reason.
    While you're certainly welcome to do so, I should point out that if that is the first place you are bringing the
    issue, it's not likely to be accepted. Arbitration cases are regularly declined because people have not tried
    other forms of dispute resolution first, and so you would be better off just following the steps at the dispute
    resolution page.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question">
  <a class="faq-link" href="#paid" aria-label="Permalink to this section">&#35;</a>
  <a
    id="paid">Were
    you paid to edit [article]?</a>
</h3>
<div class="faq-answer">
  <p>No. I don't, and have never, edited Wikipedia articles for pay. All of my editing is unpaid and on a volunteer
    basis.</p>
  <p>Occasionally someone notices that I work for a company in the marketing space and assumes that I am employed by
    them to edit Wikipedia articles for clients. This is mistaken; my company builds marketing and sales software (it
    is not a marketing agency, and does not hire people to edit Wikipedia articles for clients), and I am a software
    developer whose professional work is completely unrelated to Wikipedia.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="faq-question">
  <a class="faq-link" href="#requested-article" aria-label="Permalink to this section">&#35;
  </a>
  <a id="requested-article">Will you write an article about me/my
    business?</a>
</h3>
<div class="faq-answer">
  <p>No. I don't write articles on request. If you want someone to write a Wikipedia article about you, you can
    request it at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requested_articles">Requested Articles</a>, though
    there is always a long backlog given the number of people who wish to have articles written about themselves or
    their interests.</p>
  <p>
    If you believe you/your business/the topic you want an article about meets our <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability">notability guidelines</a> and would like to try
    writing the article yourself, you must first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount">create
      an account</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_wizard/HowToDiscloseCOI">disclose
      your conflict of interest</a>. Then you can use the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_wizard">Article Wizard</a> to draft the article and
    request review. This is much quicker and likely to be successful than putting your request at Requested Articles,
    but there is still a backlog.</p>
  <p>
    I would discourage you from paying someone to write an article about you. Although there are paid editors who do
    so legitimately, many people offering these services are out to scam you and are also quite disruptive to the
    Wikimedia communities.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="faq-question">
  <a class="faq-link" href="#simple" aria-label="Permalink to this section">&#35;</a>
  <a id="simple">I just have a simple question about a Wikipedia-related topic!</a>
</h3>
<div class="faq-answer">
  <p>In that case, feel free to ask me. If it develops into a more in-depth discussion of a specific article, however,
    I will probably redirect you to the article talk page.</p>
